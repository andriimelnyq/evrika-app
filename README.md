# EVRYKA APPLICATION

### The project is implemented by a team that includes Frontend and Backend developers and a QA engineer

[DEMO](https://evryka-app.onrender.com)

This is a comprehensive web application built on React, with React Router, used for site navigation. The development process follows the BEM methodology and includes the use of third-party libraries such as Lodash, Swiper, and MaterialUI, as well as the SASS preprocessor. Data information is obtained from the server via a GET request, which is then stored in a context. The application also features an authentication form that utilizes tokens, with login and registration forms available. Users can filter and search through a list of courses by title. Additionally, users can add courses to a selected list, view them, and buy them through a POST request to the server using token access. The selected courses and tokens are stored in localStorage, allowing them to persist even after reloading the site or browser.
